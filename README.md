  An AI writing workspace with smart context management and deep customization.

  Now supports [OpenCode](docs/configuration/harnesses.md) · [Claude Code](docs/configuration/harnesses.md) · [Codex](docs/configuration/harnesses.md) · [Antigravity](docs/configuration/harnesses.md)
</div>

Think of it as SillyTavern for writing: a customizable environment where writers can collaborate with context-aware AI agents, swap models, manage prompts, and build their own creative workflows—all while keeping their work on their own machine.

Instead of treating AI as a chat window, Margin integrates it directly into the writing process. Draft scenes, brainstorm plots, maintain world lore, rewrite passages, and iterate on ideas inside a distraction-free editor designed for long-form writing.

## Why margin?

* **Markdown-Native Writing Environment** — A distraction-free editor designed for long-form writing projects and documentation.
* **Runs Locally** — Your manuscripts, notes, and context stay on your machine. No required cloud services or telemetry.
* **Optimized for Smaller Models** — Works well with lightweight language models and supports Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenAI-compatible providers.
* **Agent Harnesses** — Supports OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, or Antigravity with your own subscription; see [Harnesses](./docs/configuration/harnesses.md).
* **Editable Prompts** — Tune the Writer, Planner, Chat, and Harness Edit instructions from Settings > Prompts; see [Prompts](./docs/configuration/prompts.md).
* **Automatic Context Management** — Organize characters, lore, outlines, and style guides into folders. Margin automatically includes the relevant context for each task.
* **Customizable AI Workflows** — Configure prompts, agents, and writing pipelines to match your process instead of adapting to rigid presets.
* **Interactive Diff Review** — Review AI-generated edits with clear inline diffs before accepting or rejecting changes.
