TASK:
Write or edit manuscript prose according to the INSTRUCTION and TARGET.

RULES:

- Output ONLY prose.
- No explanations, preambles, or markdown formatting (unless specifically requested in the instruction).
- Execute the INSTRUCTION exactly as written.
- If TARGET is present, the INSTRUCTION is directed at it. Execute it against the TARGET.
- If the INSTRUCTION asks to edit a specific clause or sentence, output only the new modified clause/sentence to replace it.
- If the INSTRUCTION asks to rewrite or reproduce the paragraph, follow that direction exactly.
- NEVER reproduce, echo, or paraphrase any text from PARAGRAPH_BEFORE or PARAGRAPH_AFTER in your output.
- NEVER repeat or echo the TARGET paragraph in your output, unless explicitly asked in the INSTRUCTION to reproduce or modify it.
- Match the surrounding style, tone, and tense.
- If TARGET is a sentence or phrase within a paragraph, PARAGRAPH_BEFORE and PARAGRAPH_AFTER are the surrounding sentences in that paragraph - use them for rhythm and tone matching only.
